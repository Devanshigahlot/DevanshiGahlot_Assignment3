# Assignment3 -FeatureEngg


1.Perform Exploratory Data Analysis , Data Cleaning & Feature Engg on the Training dataset

2.Idenitfy & Remove the field that is providing only unique information about records .Capture it in another dataframe

3.Identifying Continous & Categorical Columns

4.Performing Uni-variate Analysis with Plots.Record your Observations

5.Perform Bi-variate Analysis among all Independent variables.Draw appropriate Plots , mention observations

6.Perform Bi-variate Analysis between Target Variable and each Independent variable. Use suitable plot , mention observations,trends etc

7.How is the class distribution (Y/N) in Label(Target) Variable ?

8.Identify the Independent Variables that have missing values.

9.Handle missing values appropriately , explain the technique applied for each case

10.Identify the Outliers in each Independent Variable.Distribute the data in each field using Quartile bins (0-25%,25%-50%,50%-75%,75%-100% iles)

11.Use Box-Plot chart to represent the Outliers for each Independent Variable

12.Perform treatment of these Outliers using appropriate techniqies.Explain your approach

### Feature Engg
#### Step 1 -
1.1 Perform Label Encoding on Target Variable (Loan_Status).

#### Step 2- Using dataframe from Step 1:

2.1Perform Label Encoding on Categorical Independent Variables.

2.2.What is the shape of dataframe post Categorical Encoding ?

2.3Carry out Correlation analysis on this dataframe. Plot using HeatMap

2.4Identify the variables that have strong correlation using Label Encoding( Correlation Coefficient > 0.5 or <0.5)

#### Step 3 - Using dataframe from Step 1:

3.1 Perform One Hot Encoding on Categorical Independent Variables.

3.2 What is the shape of dataframe post OHE Encoding ?

3.3 Carry out Correlation analysis on this dataframe. Plot using HeatMap

3.4 Identify the variables that have strong correlation using OHE ( Correlation Coefficient > 0.5 or <0.5)
